    Japan's asteroid-visiting Hayabusa spacecraft wasn't a complete disaster, but it definitely got off to a rocky start. Launched in 2003, the world's first sample-return mission was quickly sidelined when it was struck by charged particles from a power...
    The Carina Nebula (NGC 3372) is a massive star-forming region within the Milky Way. Officially discovered by French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in the 1750s, the nebula stretches over 300 light-years across, so big and bright that it’s easy to spot with the naked eye. With a telescope, even more detail unfolds — but all of that detail is in visible light. Part of what makes the nebula so fantastic for amateurs, however, is exactly what professional astronomers dislike the most: dust and glowing gas that blocks the view of forming stars hidden within the visually striking but dark clouds. 
    But infrared instruments, which are capable of sensing heat, can penetrate the cooler dust and gas of the nebula to reveal what’s going on inside. Recent images from the Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA), currently the largest infrared telescope in the world dedicated to astronomical surveys, are now helping astronomers get a better grasp than ever on the inner workings of the region. So far, VISTA has helped researchers identify almost 5 million individual sources of infrared light within the nebula, cataloging forming stars down to just a tenth of the Sun’s mass. Many of these sources are either newly detected or known but poorly studied clusters of young stars.
